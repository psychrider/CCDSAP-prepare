# Welcome !!
{W.I.P} This repo has Descriptive solutions to the Data Structures and Algorithms problems in Codechef CCDSAP/prepare section. Because not all the problems have explaination, this will surely help. The problems can be found here -  https://www.codechef.com/certification/data-structures-and-algorithms/prepare .
### Notice-
- All the codes are in C++.
- All the codes have been tested to run on all the test cases.
- All the solutions are written by me only.
- Please DO NOT COPY and paste, understand and write ur own code :) .
- The problems may not be in order.
